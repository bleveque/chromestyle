chromestyle
===========

Fix styling of certain pages (e.g., to make them more legible).

At the moment, this is geared towards a very specific use case,
but it could be generalized. It will also only work if the target
page's body element does not have a font-family style rule set (very
specific indeed...).

To use
------

To use this as a local extension, navigate to chrome://extensions
in Chrome. Make sure the 'Developer Mode' box is checked, and
click 'Load unpacked extension.' Select the chromestyle directory
(from wherever it was downloaded or cloned) and make sure the
extension is enabled.

It is nascent, so the browser action icon is just the default
puzzle piece.
